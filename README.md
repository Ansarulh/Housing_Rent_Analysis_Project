  2. Standardizing Formats: Ensured consistency in city names, area units, and rent amounts.
  3. Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
  4. Converting Data Types: Ensured numeric values (rent, tax, insurance, etc.) were in proper format.


### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

Key analyses performed:
  1. Descriptive Statistics: Calculated average rent, median rent, maximum and minimum values.
  2. City-Wise Insights: Compared rent trends across major cities.
  3. Room & Rent Relation: Examined how the number of rooms impacts rent.
  4. Effect of Furniture Status: Analyzed the influence of furnishing on rent pricing.

### üìà Data Visualization (Using Excel Charts & Pivot Tables)

Visualizations used to derive meaningful insights:
  1. Rent Distribution Across Cities: Bar charts showing differences in rental costs.
  2. Correlation Matrix: Examining relationships between rent and factors like rooms and furnishing.
  3. Pivot Tables for Segmentation: Grouping by city, area, and other attributes to identify patterns.


### üîë Key Insights & Business Recommendations
####	Housing Rent & Location Correlation:
   1. Rent prices are directly proportional to location and demand.
   2. IT hubs and job opportunities significantly influence rental costs.
#### Expensive & Affordable Cities:
  1. Bangalore has the highest rental prices, approximately 60% more expensive than other metro cities.
  2. Reason: High demand due to the presence of major IT companies, attracting professionals and job seekers.
  3. Mumbai surprisingly has the lowest rent among metro cities, possibly due to varied housing options and a balance between demand and supply.
  #### Recommendations for Tenants & Property Owners:
  1. Tenants should consider emerging areas near IT hubs for affordability.
  2. Property owners in Bangalore can benefit from premium pricing due to demand.
  3. Furnishing status plays a significant role in rent variation; fully-furnished homes command higher rents.
